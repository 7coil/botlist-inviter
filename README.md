# Discord Bot Invite Services
This is an example of a user-operated invite service, automating moderator actions by getting the user to invite bots to a server instead of a moderator.

Test data from [bots.discord.pw](https://discord.bots.gg/)

## Setup
Install `X.org` onto an Ubuntu 18.04 Artful Aardvark server, as well as the `.deb` in the releases.
It is recommended that you use `Apache Guacamole` and `vnc4server` to open many instances for users.
